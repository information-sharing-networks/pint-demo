// package ebl provides high-level functions for creating DCSA PINT API requests.
//
// these functions are used by the pint-demo app to simulate the PINT workflow.
// you can refer to these functions to see how to use the crypto package to create valid PINT and issuance requests.
//
// Note for the demo service, the keys are read from disk on each request - in a production service, the keys would be loaded into memory on startup.
