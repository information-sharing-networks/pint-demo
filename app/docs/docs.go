Details of the error are in the payload of the JWS.\n\n**Trust Level Failures**\nThis platform enforces a minimum trust level for signatures,\nbased on the x5c header in the envelope manifsest JWS.\n- Trust level 1 is the lowest trust level, and means that a JWS\nwill be accepted even if no x5c header is present.\n- Trust level 2 means the JWS must contain a valid certificate,\n(Domain Validation (DV) certificates are allowed).\n- Trust level 3 is the hightest trust level, and means that the JWS must contain a valid Extended Validation (EV)\nor Organization Validation (OV) certificate.\n\nThe trust level is checked after signature verification, and a valid JWS with an insufficient trust\nlevel will return a ` + "`" + `422 Unprocessable Entity` + "`" + ` (BSIG) response.\n\nNote that if an x5c cert is included, it must be signed by a trusted root CA and the\npublic key in the certificate must match the key used to sign the JWS.\n\n**Unsigned Error Responses**\n\nThe only time you get an unsigned response is when the request is malformed or the\nreceiving platform is having technical difficulties.\n\n` + "`" + `400 Bad Request` + "`" + ` indicates a malformed request (invalid JSON, missing required fields, etc.)\n\n` + "`" + `500 Internal Server Error` + "`" + ` or other unexpected errors indicate temporary technical issues.\nThe sender should retry until they receive a signed response.\n\n**Notes**\n\nIMPORTANT: Unsigned responses cannot be verified as originating from the receiving platform\n(they may come from middleware or infrastructure). Therefore:\n- Do not assume an unsigned error means the transfer was rejected\n- only determine transfer acceptance/rejection from signed responses\n\nThe sending platform must not rely on the HTTP response status code alone as it is not covered by the signature.\nWhen there is a mismatch between the HTTP response status code\nand the ` + "`" + `responseCode` + "`" + ` in the signed response, the ` + "`" + `responseCode` + "`" + ` takes precedence.",

Unrecognized keys are rejected.\n\nIn a real production system, OAuth 2.0 service accounts would provide additional authentication and authorization capabilities,\ne.g where external clients need to initiate a transfer on behalf of a user.\n",
