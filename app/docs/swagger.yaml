    pint-server is an implemenation of the DCSA v3 PINT API for receiving eBL envelope transfers

    ## Common Error Responses
    All endpoints may return:
    - `413` Request body exceeds size limit
    - `429` Rate limit exceeded
    - `500` Internal server error

    Individual endpoints document their specific business logic errors.

    ## Request Limits
    All endpoints are protected by:
    - **Rate limiting**: Configurable requests per second (see env vars) - default 100 rps (set to 0 to disable)
    - **Request size limits**: Configurable (see env vars) - default 1MB

    Check the X-Max-Request-Body response header for the configured limit on signals payload.

    The rate limit is set globaly and prevents abuse of the service.
    In production there will be additional protections in place such as per-IP rate limiting provided by the load balancer/reverse proxy.

    ## Authentication & Authorization

    The pint-demo PINT APIs do not require credentials to be sent with the request.
    Participating platforms are authenticated via JWS signatures -
    requests must be signed with a key registered in the platform registry. Unrecognized keys are rejected.

    In a real production system, OAuth 2.0 service accounts would provide additional authentication and authorization capabilities,
    e.g where external clients need to initiate a transfer on behalf of a user.

  /v3/envelopes:
    post:
      description: |-
        Initiates an eBL envelope transfer. The sender provides the transport document (eBL),
        signed envelope manifest, and complete transfer chain.

        The receiving platform validates signatures, checksums, and transfer chain integrity.

        **Success Responses:**

        `201 Created` - Transfer started but not yet accepted
        - The envelope transfer is now active
        - Additional documents listed in the EnvelopeManifest are required
        - Sender must transfer documents, then call "Finish envelope transfer" endpoint
        - Only at finish will the transfer be accepted or rejected with a signed response

        Retry handling - if the sender attempts to start a transfer for an eBL that already has an active transfer,
        the receiver assumes the sender has lost track of the state of the transfer.
        In this case, the request is treated as a retry and the existing envelope
        reference and current missing documents are returned with HTTP 201.

        `200 OK` - Transfer accepted immediately (with signed response)
        - No additional documents required, or receiver already has all documents
        - The response body contains a JWS (JSON Web Signature) token, where
        the payload contains the response details.

        The payload includes the `responseCode`: `RECE` (accepted) or `DUPE` (duplicate).
        `DUPE` means this transfer was previously received and accepted - in this case the response
        also includes the last accepted transfer chain entry
        `duplicateOfAcceptedEnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent` which the sender can use
        to confirm which transfer was accepted.

        **Error Responses**

        `422 Unprocessable Entity` indicates the platform has rejected the transfer.
        The response body contains a JWS token with `responseCode` of `BSIG` (signature failure)
        or `BENV` (envelope validation failure). Details of the error are in the payload of the JWS.

        **Trust Level Failures**
        This platform enforces a minimum trust level for signatures,
        based on the x5c header in the envelope manifsest JWS.
        - Trust level 1 is the lowest trust level, and means that a JWS
        will be accepted even if no x5c header is present.
        - Trust level 2 means the JWS must contain a valid certificate,
        (Domain Validation (DV) certificates are allowed).
        - Trust level 3 is the hightest trust level, and means that the JWS must contain a valid Extended Validation (EV)
        or Organization Validation (OV) certificate.

        The trust level is checked after signature verification, and a valid JWS with an insufficient trust
        level will return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` (BSIG) response.

        Note that if an x5c cert is included, it must be signed by a trusted root CA and the
        public key in the certificate must match the key used to sign the JWS.

        **Unsigned Error Responses**

        The only time you get an unsigned response is when the request is malformed or the
        receiving platform is having technical difficulties.

        `400 Bad Request` indicates a malformed request (invalid JSON, missing required fields, etc.)

        `500 Internal Server Error` or other unexpected errors indicate temporary technical issues.
        The sender should retry until they receive a signed response.

        **Notes**

        IMPORTANT: Unsigned responses cannot be verified as originating from the receiving platform
        (they may come from middleware or infrastructure). Therefore:
        - Do not assume an unsigned error means the transfer was rejected
        - only determine transfer acceptance/rejection from signed responses

        The sending platform must not rely on the HTTP response status code alone as it is not covered by the signature.
        When there is a mismatch between the HTTP response status code
        and the `responseCode` in the signed response, the `responseCode` takes precedence.
