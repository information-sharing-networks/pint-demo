    pint-demo is an implemenation of the DCSA v3 PINT API for receiving eBL envelope transfers

    ## Common Error Responses
    All endpoints may return:
    - `413` Request body exceeds size limit
    - `429` Rate limit exceeded
    - `500` Internal server error

    Individual endpoints document their specific business logic errors.

    ## Request Limits
    All endpoints are protected by:
    - **Rate limiting**: Configurable requests per second (see env vars) - default 100 rps (set to 0 to disable)
    - **Request size limits**: Configurable (see env vars) - default 1MB

    Check the X-Max-Request-Body response header for the configured limit on signals payload.

    The rate limit is set globaly and prevents abuse of the service.
    In production there will be additional protections in place such as per-IP rate limiting provided by the load balancer/reverse proxy.

    ## Authentication & Authorization

    The pint-demo PINT APIs do not require credentials to be sent with the request.
    Participating platforms are authenticated via JWS signatures -
    requests must be signed with a key registered in the platform registry. Unrecognized keys are rejected.

    In a real production system, OAuth 2.0 service accounts would provide additional authentication and authorization capabilities,
    e.g where external clients need to initiate a transfer on behalf of a user.

  /v3/envelopes:
    post:
      description: |-
        Initiates an eBL envelope transfer. The sender provides the transport document (eBL),
        signed envelope manifest, and complete transfer chain.

        The receiving platform validates signatures, checksums, and transfer chain integrity.

        **Success Responses:**

        `201 Created` - Transfer started (not yet accepted)
        - The envelope transfer is now active
        - Additional documents listed in the EnvelopeManifest are required
        - Sender must transfer documents, then call "Finish envelope transfer" endpoint
        - Only at finish will the transfer be accepted or rejected (signed response)

        Retry handling - if the sender attempts to start a transfer for an eBL that already has an active transfer,
        the receiver assumes the sender has lost track of the state of the transer.
        In this case, the request is treated as a retry and the existing envelope
        reference and current missing documents are returned with HTTP 201.

        `200 OK` - Transfer accepted immediately (with signed response)
        - No additional documents required, OR receiver already has all documents
        - the signed response includes `responseCode`: `RECE` (accepted) or `DUPE` (duplicate)

        `DUPE` means this transfer was previously accepted - in this case the response
        also includes the last accepted transfer chain entry
        `duplicateOfAcceptedEnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent` which the sender can use
        to verify which transfer was accepted.
